- **For non-UX students:** Summarize what you included in your first release canvas and why the features in that release canvas create a complete feature set.

    In our first release canvas we decided to refactor the existing code base to be more efficient. We also
    decided to redesign the look and layout of the entire site. After our changes have been completed the site looks and feels much more smoothe and modern.
